# Upgrading to v5

Welcome UI V5 focuses on the rework of our **foundations** and moving from reakit to **ariakit**.

## Upgrade steps

### 1. Update your dependencies

Make sure you update all `@welcome-ui` packages and `styled-components` packages:

```json
{
  "dependencies": {
    "@welcome-ui/YOUR_PACKAGE": "^5.0.0",
    "@xstyled/styled-components": "^3.7.3",
    "styled-components": "^5.3.9"
  }
}
```

### 2. Migrate foundations

We reworked our theme's colors, spacing, typography, and many other properties. Use the migration script to migrate easily to V5 on a welcome-ui project.

```bash
yarn migrate "../yourProject/src/**/**.**(tsx|ts|js)"
```

### 3. Migrate Reakit to Ariakit

We also migrated to the new **[Ariakit](https://ariakit.org)** library _(reakit v2)_ on some of our components. To migrate easily, you can find components migration below.

To resume:

- We now pass on a `store` property the component's state and remove "State" from the hook name.

```diff live=false
- const drawerState = useDrawerState()
+ const drawer = useDrawer()

- <Drawer {...useDrawerState}>
+ <Drawer store={drawer}>
```

- `visible` is now replaced by the `open` property
- To force open a component, use now the `defaultOpen` property

```diff live=false
- const drawerState = useDrawerState({ open: true })
+ const drawer = useDrawer({ defaultOpen: true })
```

- Access the actual component's state with `useState`:

```diff live=false
- const drawerState = useDrawerState()
- const isOpen = drawerState.visible
+ const drawer = useDrawer()
+ const isOpen = drawer.useState('open')
```

## Theme

### Colors

We changed our colors dark and light to be fully compatible with the coming dark mode (in beta). Now dark are black rgba with transparency, and light white rgba with transparency.

We also had to rework our colors naming for typescript compatibility reasons:

- Before: `colors.dark.900`
- After: `colors['dark-900']`

We rework some colors:

- **v4 compare to v5**
- [success/danger/warning/info].500 <-> [success/danger/warning/info]-300
- [success/danger/warning/info].700 <-> [success/danger/warning/info]-400
- new color [success/danger/warning/info]-500
- nude.400 <-> nude-500
- nude.500 <-> nude-400
- nude.700 <-> nude-600
- nude.800 <-> nude-700
- ** the light colors are all white with opacity, you need to replace the old light color for text with new black color **
  - light.800 <-> dark-100
  - light.700 <-> dark-200
  - light.500 <-> dark-400
  - light.200 <-> dark-400
  - light.100 <-> dark-500
  - now the light colors variants are 100, 200, 400, 500, 700, 900(without opacity)
- ** the dark colors are all black with opacity, it's also used for text color **
  - dark.100 <-> dark-500
  - dark.200 <-> dark-700
  - dark.500 <-> dark.900
  - dark.700 <-> dark.900
  - dark.800 <-> dark.900
  - now the dark colors variants are 100, 200, 400, 500, 700, 900(without opacity)
- new color white (get the light.900 for dark mode)
- new color black (get the dark.900 for dark mode)
- the color for html is now dark-500

### Spacing

We rework our spacing:

- **v5 compare to v4**
- xxs (2px) <-> new size (before it was 6px)
- xs (4px) <-> new size (before it was 8px)
- sm (8px) <-> xs
- md (12px) <-> same size
- lg (16px) <-> lg (15px)
- xl (24px) <-> xxl
- xxl (32px) <-> 3xl (30px)
- 3xl (48px) <-> 5xl (50px)
- 4xl (64px) <-> 6xl
- 5xl (96px) -> new size
- 6xl (128px) -> new size

- body2 become `md`
- body3 become `sm`
- body4 become `xs`

## Components

```
