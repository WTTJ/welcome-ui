#### textsTextTransform

We removed useless entry textsTextTransform on global theme.

### Icons

- 1 icon deleted (doublon with `EditIcon`)
  - `pen`
- 12 new icons added:
  - `avatar_accessory`
  - `avatar_body`
  - `avatar_bottom`
  - `avatar_costume`
  - `avatar_head`
  - `avatar_top`
  - `common_area`
  - `meeting_room`
  - `bookmark`
  - `bookmark_outline`
  - `equal`
- 2 icons modified :
  - `screenshare_off`
  - `screenshare_on`

### Text component

We reduce the size (and variant) of headings on mobile :

- h0 > h1
- h1 > h2
- h2 > h3
- h3 > h4
- h4 > h5
- h5 > h6

### ConnectedField component

The ConnectedField component was built to work with react-final-form and was not generic enough so we have decided to remove it on v4.

### Field component

The Field component will not accept `component` prop anymore but wrap your input directly, this makes it possible to give styled props to the Wrapper **and** the Input component. For more information on the new syntax, [check the documentation](/components/field)

### Others

- Use `w="100%"` instead of `w={1}`
- Use `h="100%"` instead of `h={1}`

## Other versions

- [Version 3](upgrades/v3)
- [Version 2](upgrades/v2)
