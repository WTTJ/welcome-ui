# Upgrade

Version 5: Rework of our foundations

## Breaking Changes

### Theme

#### Colors

We changed our colors dark and light to be full compatible with dark mode. Now dark are black rgba with transparency, and light are white rgba with transparency.

We need also for typescript compatibility rework our colors naming :

- Before : `colors.dark.900`
- After : `colors['dark-900']`

We rework some colors:

- **v4 compare to v5**
- [success/danger/warning/info].500 <-> [success/danger/warning/info]-300
- [success/danger/warning/info].700 <-> [success/danger/warning/info]-400
- new color [success/danger/warning/info]-500
- nude.400 <-> nude-500
- nude.500 <-> nude-400
- nude.700 <-> nude-600
- nude.800 <-> nude-700
- ** the light colors are all white with opacity, you need to replace the old light color for text with new black color **
  - light.800 <-> dark-100
  - light.700 <-> dark-200
  - light.500 <-> dark-400
  - light.200 <-> dark-400
  - light.100 <-> dark-500
  - now the light colors variants are 100, 200, 400, 500, 700, 900(without opacity)
- ** the dark colors are all black with opacity, it's also used for text color **
  - dark.100 <-> dark-500
  - dark.200 <-> dark-700
  - dark.500 <-> dark.900
  - dark.700 <-> dark.900
  - dark.800 <-> dark.900
  - now the dark colors variants are 100, 200, 400, 500, 700, 900(without opacity)
- new color white (get the light.900 for dark mode)
- new color black (get the dark.900 for dark mode)
- the color for html is now dark-500
