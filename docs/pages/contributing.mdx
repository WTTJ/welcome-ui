## Commit message convention

We follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention ✨

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

- fix: patches a bug in your codebase
- feat: introduces a new feature to the codebase
- BREAKING CHANGE: introduces a breaking API change
- refactor: introduce code refactor
- docs: changes into documentation
- test: adding or updating tests
- chore: tooling changes, chore changes

We have a pre-commit hook to verify if your commit is correct 🚔

## Writing components

Each component will consist of:

- `ComponentName`: Folder with name of component (PascalCase)
  - `index.js`: The React component
  - `index.test.js`: Jest tests for this component
  - `styles.js`: Any related `styled-components`
  - `doc.mdx`: Documentation on `Docz`
  - `utils.js` : util for this component

## Reporting issues

You can report issues on our [github project](https://github.com/WTTJ/welcome-ui/issues) 🐛

## Adding icons

If you add or update an icon (by adding/updating an SVG to `icons/_assets`), the build process will:

- optimise the icon (using SVGO)
- write it to the main `Icon` package
- write it to the `IconFont` package

You can also process the icons using `yarn icons:optimize && yarn icons:collect`.

Note: Writing to the `IconFont` package will only happen if there are new icons added or if you pass `--force` e.g. `yarn icons:optimize && yarn icons:collect --force`.
