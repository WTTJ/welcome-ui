It is based on the [react-datepicker](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker) library. [All the props](https://github.com/Hacker0x01/react-datepicker/blob/main/docs/datepicker.md) the library exposes can be passed to either DatePicker or TimePicker.

_Note_: Pass a value of `null` if you don't want the default value of `Date.now()`.

### Pass props to childs

If you want to pass props to DatePicker or TimePicker you need to see example below

<div data-playground="childs.tsx" data-component="DateTimePicker"></div>

- `xs` (24px)
- `sm` (32px)
- `md` (40px - default)
- `lg` (48px)

<div data-playground="sizes.tsx" data-component="DateTimePicker"></div>

### Transparent
