FileDrop uses render props to give you more flexibility on what to render at each state change:

- `isDefault`: No file uploaded and no user interaction
- `isHoverAccept`: File is being dragged over and matches the `accept` string
- `isHoverReject`: File is being dragged over but does _not_ match the `accept` string

You also have access to:

- `openFile`: To open the native file chooser dialog box
- `fileUrl`: URL of file if one has been opened/dropped (to show a preview)

By default, `accept`: is set to `{ "image/*": [] }`. See more about [showOpenFilePicker](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/showOpenFilePicker#examples) and [media type](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Basics_of_HTTP/MIME_types/Common_types).

### Custom wordings

By default:

- `title`: is set to `"Add file"`
- `hint`: is set to `"Drag & drop a file here or"`
- `fileButtonText`: is set to `"Browse file"`
- `previewButtonText`: is set to `"Preview"`

You can override translations with a `wordings` object.

<div data-playground="wordings.tsx" data-component="FileDrop"></div>

#### With preview

<div data-playground="preview.tsx" data-component="FileDrop"></div>

### Preview

#### Image

<div data-playground="image.tsx" data-component="FileDrop"></div>

#### Other

<div data-playground="others.tsx" data-component="FileDrop"></div>

### Without type

Sometime in the url we don't have the type of the file, you can override with `forceFileType` set to `image`, `audio` or `video`.

<div data-playground="no-type.tsx" data-component="FileDrop"></div>

### With a custom filename

By default, the filename is retrieved from the url. If you want to display a custom filename, you can use the `fileName` prop.

<div data-playground="custom-filename.tsx" data-component="FileDrop"></div>

### Disabled

<div data-playground="disabled.tsx" data-component="FileDrop"></div>
