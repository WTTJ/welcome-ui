### Avatar

<div data-playground="avatar.tsx" data-component="Accordion"></div>

### Open at start

Add `defaultOpen` options to `useAccordion` to open the accordion at the start.

<div data-playground="open-at-start.tsx" data-component="Accordion"></div>

### With a custom icon

Customize the icon with a node element on the `icon` property. Note that the custom icon's size property will be set to small.

<div data-playground="with-custom-icon.tsx" data-component="Accordion"></div>

### useAccordion

We use `useDisclosureStore` from [Ariakit Disclosure](https://ariakit.org/reference/use-disclosure-store) for the state of the accordion, with the `animated` flag set to true by default.

Pass options to `useAccordion`:

- **defaultOpen:** `const accordion = useAccordion({ defaultOpen: true })`

The hook returns (among other things):

- **useState('open')**: whether the accordion is currently open
- **hide**: a function to hide the accordion
