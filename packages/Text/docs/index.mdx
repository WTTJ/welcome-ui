### Overwrite tag

You can pass a tag name with `as` to use that tag type with the styling from another tag. For exampleâ€¦

<div data-playground="overwrite.tsx" data-component="Text"></div>

### Truncation

Set the number of lines you want to display with `lines`. Your text will be displayed truncated with an ellipsis (`...`) at the end (if necessary).

<div data-playground="truncation.tsx" data-component="Text"></div>
