### Variants

<div data-playground="variants.tsx" data-component="Alert"></div>

### Sizes

By default the size is `sm`.

<div data-playground="sizes.tsx" data-component="Alert"></div>

### Only a title

We include an icon that matches the variant, but you have the option to remove it or replace it with a custom node.

<div data-playground="title.tsx" data-component="Alert"></div>

### With CTA

When the `cta` prop is used, it will be displayed in a column on the right.

<div data-playground="cta.tsx" data-component="Alert"></div>

### Full Width

Set property `isFullWidth` to take the full width of the parent.

<div data-playground="is-full-width.tsx" data-component="Alert"></div>

### CloseButton

To show a close button you need to pass your function on the `handleClose` property.

<div data-playground="close-button.tsx" data-component="Alert"></div>
