> Yay:  
> This template contains some sample content on components, and a suggested page layout. You can use what you like from it to create your own documentation, and delete anything you don’t want to keep.

## Component title

> Some extra info:  
> Start with an image or Figma frame showing your component. Include a short description in a text block if required, and then add a component checklist block to display selected properties of the component in detail.

### Usage 

> Some extra info:  
> You can include usage guidelines, so the consumers of your design system know when to use this component, or when to avoid it. For example, should this component only be used in a banner? Should it always be placed next to a button component?

### Variants

> Some extra info:  
> Define how the user can interact with the component here. Does it have different sizes, or types? You can list any different states here, like hover, or focus. Connect your Figma file containing your components and display these variants in a Frame block.

### Code block

> Finally, when documenting individual components from your design system in detail, it’s nice to include a code block for that component too. Reach out to your developers to discover how best to display their code in one of our code blocks.
