# Design tokens

---

> Yay:  
> This template contains some sample content on styles and design tokens. It’s ideal for documenting a specific token type, like colors. You can use what you like from it to create your own documentation, and delete anything you don’t want to keep.

## Base tokens

> Some extra info:  
> Use a token list block, or token group block, to display the base set of tokens for this style. This is where you pick all your base colors, like ‘Red 500’ or ‘Blue 300’, for example.

Token list:

Token group:

  
**Token Group Shades / Dark**:    
100: rgb(229, 229, 229)  
400: rgb(153, 153, 153)  
500: rgb(115, 115, 115)  
700: rgb(76, 76, 76)  
900: rgb(0, 0, 0)  


### Usage

> Some extra info:  
> Include information on how and when to use these tokens. There are a lot of ways to show this information, but we usually recommend a simple bullet list block or table block.

## Semantic tokens

> Some extra info:  
> Use a token list block, or token group block, to display the semantic set of tokens for this style. This is where you show semantic layers of design tokens, like ‘Color Primary’ or ‘Color Background Page’, for example.
