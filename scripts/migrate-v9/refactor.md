Here are some simplifications and improvements you could make to your process-components.mjs migration script:

---

### 1. **Prettier Config Loading**

- You already optimized this: load .prettierrc once at the top. Good!

### 2. **Component Lookup**

- Instead of using `matchIndex` and a `Map`, you could traverse the AST and match by tag/component name and location, reducing the need for a separate lookup if your AST traversal is robust.

### 3. **Classname/Props Transformation**

- **DONE:** Extracted the logic for building new classnames and attributes into a `buildAttributes` helper function. The main loop now calls this helper, making the code cleaner and more maintainable.

### 4. **Prompt Logic**

- **DONE:** The interactive prompt logic is now extracted into a reusable async function `promptUserForAction`, which is called in the main loop for clarity and maintainability.

### 5. **Error Handling**

- You can remove unused error variables (e.g., `catch (e) {}`) or at least log them for debugging.

### 6. **File Writing**

- **DONE:** Files are now only written once in the summary section if in replace mode. The redundant per-file write has been removed.

### 7. **Variable Naming**

- **DONE:** More descriptive variable names are now used for clarity (e.g., `componentInfo` instead of `component`).

### 8. **Reduce Console Output in Non-Interactive Mode**

- **DONE:** Transformation details are now only printed if in interactive mode or if a verbose flag is set.

### 9. **Async/Await Consistency**

- Ensure all async operations (like Prettier formatting) are properly awaited and errors are handled.

**Example: Extracting attribute/classname logic**

```js
function buildAttributes(component, classnames) {
  // ...returns the new attributes array for the JSX element
}
```

**Example: Extracting prompt logic**

```js
async function promptUserForAction() {
  // ...returns 'replace', 'skip', or 'quit'
}
```

---

**Summary:**

- Extract repeated logic into helpers.
- Remove unused variables and redundant file writes.
- Make the main migration loop as declarative and readable as possible.

Would you like a concrete refactor of a specific section, or a sample of how to structure these helpers?
