## Anatomy

A button comprises a label in a container that can also display an icon, an arrow or both.

- *Label* Concise wording that will trigger a related action.

- *Icon* (optional) Pictogram that can dress the button and further explain the label. Can either be left-aligned or right-aligned.

- *Arrow* (optional) Pictogram that indicates a dropdown. By default the arrow points down. When the dropdown is open, the arrow points up.

- *Container* Background of the component that can either be filled, outlined or null.
