# Welcome!

You’ve landed in your new design system documentation.

---

In case you're not too sure where to begin, we've provided some templates for you to fill out. You can also learn more about different parts of the product, and how to join our community, right here.

Enjoy exploring Supernova!

## Documentation templates

To help get you started with your design system documentation, we’ve added some templates you can use — they have some suggestions on what to include, and share some of examples of blocks you can use to show off your design system content. You can absolutely use any template for any purpose, but this is how we’ve set them up:

  
| Column 1 | Column 2 |  
| --- | --- |  
| Template | Use |  
| *Design tokens* | Documenting specific design attributes — colors, shadows, radii, and so on. |  
| *Typography* | Documenting the type stack you’re using. |  
| *Component overview* | Displaying an overview of all the components in your design system, with links to either Figma, or pages in your documentation, or both. |  
| *Component detail* | Documenting a component (or set of components) — buttons, input fields, modals, popovers, and so on. |  


You can duplicate any of these templates, and fill them with your own content, or siply overwrite what's already in there if you only want to use them once. 

### Sharing your documentation

Nobody will have access to your documentation until you share it.

Everything in the editor will be autosaved, so your work will be preserved if you need to step away and come back to it later.

You can click the `*Publish*` button to build and update your documentation site. Even after you publish, your documentation can still only be seen by people you've shared it with (if any).

When you make changes in the editor (or change certain documentation settings), they won’t be seen in your live documentation until you Publish it again.

You can also adjust your privacy settings in the Settings page, so you can choose whether your documentation is publicly available, or can only be seen by those who are logged in to your workspace and have the link.

You can access all the other parts of the platform from the left navigation menu. Here’s a quick tour if you’re not sure where to start.

### Design system data

This is where all the data in your design system lives. Here, you can edit and manage design tokens, components, assets and so on. This data is then used to populate things your design system documentation.

### Data sources

In this section, you can choose sources for your design system data, and import content from them. This basically means importing design tokens, components, etc. from your Figma libraries. You can also import data via our Tokens Studio integration.

### Code integration

Here, you can export your design system data as code, set up integrations with your repositories, and automate your code delivery for seamless hand-off.
