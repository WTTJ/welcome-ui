## Workflow

- Create your branch from main
- Run `yarn` to setup the development environment.
- Make the changes you want and test them out in the demo website before sending a pull request.
- Add all necessary information and examples in your pull request.

## Commit message convention

We follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention ‚ú®

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

- <strong>fix</strong>: patches a bug in your codebase
- <strong>feat</strong>: introduces a new feature to the codebase
- <strong>BREAKING CHANGE</strong>: introduces a breaking API change
- <strong>refactor</strong>: introduce code refactor
- <strong>docs</strong>: changes into documentation
- <strong>test</strong>: adding or updating tests
- <strong>chore</strong>: tooling changes, chore changes

We have a pre-commit hook to verify if your commit is correct üöî

## Writing components

Each component will consist of:

- `ComponentName`: Folder with name of component (PascalCase)
  - `index.tsx`: The React component
  - `component-name.module.scss`: Any related styles with sass
  - `types.ts`: Typescript types for this component
  - `utils.ts` : Utilities for this component
  - `docs` : Documentation for this component [See more](#documentation)
  - `index.test.ts`: vitest + react-testing-library tests

## Reporting issues

You can report issues on our [github project](https://github.com/WTTJ/welcome-ui/issues) üêõ

## Documentation

Our documentation is based on NextJS with mdx files and nodejs script.

### For a Component

All component documentation is now located in its repository's `docs` folder:

- `index.mdx`:
  - **Header**: Contains the following information:
    - `ariakit`: Link (if used in this component, will be transformed into a button on the page header)
    - `description`: From ChatGPT
    - `name`
    - `packageName`: Name of the npm package
    - `usage`: If needed, for example, if the import is different from the component name
- `/examples`:
  - **overview.mdx**: The main example shown at the top of the component page
  - Others: Your other examples
- `properties.json`: Auto-generated with `yarn watch`. It includes the list of the component's properties.

### For a foundation page

Simply add your new page on it, it's magic!
