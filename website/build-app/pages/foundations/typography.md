> Yay:  
> This template contains some sample content on typography documentation, and a suggested page layout. You can use what you like from it to create your own documentation, and delete anything you don’t want to keep.

## Font family

> Some extra info:  
> Start by sharing the font used in your design system. You can use an image or Figam frame block to show a preview of the fonts you're using. 

### Available styles

> Some extra info:  
> Show readers how your font styles are named in Figma, and what each style’s intended use is, for example, 'Header 1', or 'Helper text'. 
You can use a token group or token list block for this.
