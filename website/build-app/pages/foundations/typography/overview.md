Welcome to the Jungle has two typefaces that you can find [*in this Drive*](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1mjkzzKjayvSwICriBkEKgSlQ1eaui7-u).

- The first is our bespoke headline typeface, called [*Welcome*](https://www.welcometothejungle.com/fr/articles/welcome-font-creation-police-caracteres).

- The other is [*Work Sans*](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Work+Sans), a Google Font typeface.

## Welcome Web

Our headline typeface has been specially crafted for Welcome to the Jungle. It embodies our brand personality traits, and gives our typography a distinct visual character. We always set it with tight leading and letter spacing.

The font was designed by [*Violaine & Jérémy*](https://vj-type.com/). You can access the presentation [*here*](https://trello-attachments.s3.amazonaws.com/5c500c925c4b214e5ddb9a32/5c7e41c606810610402d8b12/6f1830e4994f02dac30b6864894a457b/190312-WTTJ-Typeface-Presentation.pdf).

## Work Sans

Work Sans is our secondary typeface. We use it for smaller text and longer paragraphs. Work Sans is optimised for digital use and small sizes. It has a warm and smart character, which pairs excellently with our more charismatic headline typeface. We almost always use the regular weight. The medium weight is reserved for peculiar digital applications, same with semi bold (CTA).
