# Version 9: Migrate to tailwindcss

Hi, today we are releasing version 9 of Welcome UI. This new version includes the migration to `tailwindcss` and the removal of `xstyled` and `styled-components`. It's a big change, but it will allow us to simplify design system and better performance.

## Upgrade steps

### 1. Upgrade your dependencies

TODO

### 2. Script to migrate

In welcome-ui repository, run this script:

```bash
yarn migrate '../your_project_path'
```

### 3. Fix remaining issues

We cannot cover all cases, so you may have to fix some issues manually.

## Components changes

### Icon

We removed the IconFont component and replaced it with a new Icon component that uses SVG icons. If you already use Icon component, you don't need to change anything (except if you use color or size props, see below).

```diff
-import { IconFont } from '@welcome-ui/icon-font'
+import { NameIcon } from '@welcome-ui/icon'
```

We also remove color props, you can now use tailwind text class to change the color of the icon.

```diff
-<CheckIcon color="neutral-60"  />
+<CheckIcon className="text-neutral-60" />
```

Size props are only for intern values (xs, sm, ...), you can now use tailwind size class to change the size of the icon if is custom.

```diff
-<CheckIcon size="24"  />
+<CheckIcon className="size-[24px]" />
```

### Popover

The `animated` prop in `usePopover` and `usePopoverHover` hooks is no longer supported. If you want to customize the animation duration, you can use `hideTimeout` and `showTimeout` props.

```diff
-const popover = usePopover({ animated: 200 })
+const popover = usePopover({ hideTimeout: 200, showTimeout: 200 })
```
