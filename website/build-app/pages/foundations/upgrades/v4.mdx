### Text component

We reduced the size (and variant) of headings on mobile:

- h0 > h1
- h1 > h2
- h2 > h3
- h3 > h4
- h4 > h5
- h5 > h6

### Components

#### Drawer

The Drawer component has to be wrapped with a Backdrop component, visible by default. If you don't want the Backdrop to be visible, you can pass it a `backdropVisible` prop set to `false`.

This decision was made for browser compatibility purpose.

#### ConnectedField

The ConnectedField component was built to work with react-final-form and was not generic enough so we have decided to remove it on v4.

#### Field

The Field component will not accept `component` prop anymore but wrap your input directly, this makes it possible to give styled props to the Wrapper **and** the Input component. For more information on the new syntax, [check the documentation](/components/field)

You can also [check an example](components/hook-form) with React Hook Form.

#### Group

`Group` component become `ButtonGroup`

#### New components

- new `AspectRatio` component [show more](/components/aspect-ratio)
- new `Flex` component [show more](/components/flex)
- new `Grid` component [show more](/components/grid)
