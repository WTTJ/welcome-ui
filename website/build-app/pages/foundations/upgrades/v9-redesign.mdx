Hi, today we are releasing a new batch in the v9, with redesigned components.

## Upgrade steps

### 1. Upgrade your dependencies

TODO

### 2. Script to migrate

In welcome-ui repository, run this script to change styled props to tailwind classes in your project, and apply other breaking changes from components listed below.

```bash
yarn migrate '../your_project_path' --replace
```

You will have to confirm each change, you can press `y` to apply the change, `n` to skip it, `a` to apply all remaining changes and `q` to quit.

If you want to see the changes before applying them, you can run the script without `--replace` flag:

```bash
yarn migrate '../your_project_path/subfolder'
```

#### Example of changes

TODO

### 3. Fix remaining issues

We cannot cover all cases, so you may have to fix some issues manually. Check `_CSS_TO_EDIT` comments in your code to find them, and check the list of components changes below.

## Components changes

### Button

The shape variants no longer exist. All the buttons have the same border-radius now. The `xs` size has been removed, `lg` is the new default size. New sizes are `sm`, `md` and `lg`.

### Avatar

We removed the `size` prop values `xl` and `xxl`. The new available sizes are:

- sm become xs
- md become sm
- lg become md
- xl become lg
