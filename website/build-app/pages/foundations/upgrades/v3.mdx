# Upgrading to v3

11 March 2021

We upgraded some core libraries:

- React: 17
- xStyled: 2
- Reakit: 1.3.6
- React Final Form: 6.5.2
- DatePicker: 3.6.0
- Downshift: 6.1.0

### Breaking Changes

After the upgrade to xStyled 2 there are some breaking changes:

- Change `width` & `height` props to `w` & `h`, except for DOM elements (e.g. images)
- Change `gridGap` prop to `gap`
- Add `theme.inset` (equal to space) for `top`, `left`, `right`, `bottom`
- `theme.breakpoints` is now `theme.screens`
- `theme.transitionCurves` is now `theme.timingFunctions`
- `styled.box` might not work as expected anymore
