## Upgrade steps

### 1. Script to migrate

In your project, run this script to rename all `@welcome-ui/*` imports to `welcome-ui/*` with CamelCase:

```bash
yarn migrate "../your-project/src/**/**.*{ts,tsx}"
```

### 2. Update your dependencies

In your project, remove all `@welcome-ui` packages:

```bash
yarn remove $(grep -o "@welcome-ui/[a-zA-Z0-9-]*" package.json | sort | uniq)
```

And add new package:

```bash
yarn add welcome-ui
```

### 4. Other changes

1. `WuiTheme` becomes `ThemeValues`
2. `WuiProvider` is now exported from `welcome-ui/WuiProvider`
