## Write meaningful labels

Labels should clearly transcribe what action will occur if the user triggers the button. They should always start with a verb, be short and in sentence case.

Try sticking to the standards, especially for CRUD labels (Save, Delete, Create, etc.) so that the user feels reassured and confident about clicking.

*Write overly wordy labels and reinvent well-known standards.
