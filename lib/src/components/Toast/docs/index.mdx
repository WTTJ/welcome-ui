description: The Toast component is a transient, non-blocking notification that appears briefly to provide feedback to the user. It is typically used to display messages such as success, error, warning, or informational alerts. Toasts appear at a designated area of the screen, often at the bottom or top, and automatically disappear after a few seconds, ensuring a smooth and unobtrusive user experience.

Toast component with [react-hot-toast](https://react-hot-toast.com/) and 2 components:

- Growl
- Snackbar

### Notifications

Before using the component, you must add the `Toast` component in your project root. This component will contain all your toasts.

```jsx
function App() {
  return <Toast />
}
```

### toast

Use `toast` function to show the toast element. This function returns a unique identifier that can be used to update or remove the toast later.

#### Options

The `toast` function takes a component to be displayed and an `options` object:

- **position**: one of `top-left`, `top-center`, `top-right`, `bottom-left`, `bottom-center` or `bottom-right`
- **duration**: before closing the element, in ms, with a default `7000`. It can also be set to `null` to prevent your element from closing automatically.
- **id**: a unique identifier for the toast that can be used to update or remove it later and prevent duplicates

### Position

<div data-playground="toast.tsx" data-component="Toast"></div>

### Supplied components

You can create your own notification component to display in the Toast or one of our default components: `Snackbar` and `Growl`.

In general:

- `Snackbar` is used to display a temporary, information-only notification, and
- `Growl` is used to display a more important notification with an action (that requires the user to close the notification)

### Snackbar

At bottom center by default.

<div data-playground="snackbar.tsx" data-component="Toast"></div>

### Growl

At top right by default.

<div data-playground="growl.tsx" data-component="Toast"></div>

### Custom close function

You can add your custom function when user click on close button

<div data-playground="custom-close.tsx" data-component="Toast"></div>

## Without close button on Growl or Snackbar

You can choose not to show a close button on Growl or Snackbar with the `hasCloseButton` prop (defaults to `true`).

<div data-playground="without-close.tsx" data-component="Toast"></div>

## Latency

You can choose to hide the progress bar on Snackbar with the `hideProgressBar` prop (defaults to `false`).

For the Growl, the progress bar is hidden by default, you can show it with the `showProgressBar` prop (defaults to `false`).

<div data-playground="latency.tsx" data-component="Toast"></div>

### Close or dismiss a toast

You can close or dismiss a toast programmatically with the `dismiss` and `remove` functions. Dismiss will hide the toast with a fade out animation, while remove will hide the toast immediately.

```jsx
const toastId = toast(<Toast />)

// Remove or dismiss this specific toast
remove(toastId)
dismiss(toastId)

// Remove or dismiss all toasts
remove()
dismiss()
```
