description: The Stepper component is a user interface element that guides users through a multi-step process or workflow. It visually represents the sequence of steps involved, allowing users to easily navigate between them. Each step can be marked as completed or open, providing clear feedback on the user's progress. This component is particularly useful in forms, onboarding processes, and any scenario where tasks need to be broken down into manageable stages.

### Stepper.Item

Use the `Stepper.Item` component to define each individual step within the Stepper. Each item can represent a distinct stage in the process, and you can customize its appearance based on properties `isCompleted` prop to display a checked icon for completed steps, and the `isOpen` prop to show an open folder icon for steps that are currently being worked on.

<div data-playground="item.tsx" data-component="Stepper"></div>

### Stepper.Separator

The `Stepper.Separator` component is used to visually separate individual steps within the Stepper. It helps to enhance the clarity of the step sequence by providing a distinct division between each step.

<div data-playground="separator.tsx" data-component="Stepper"></div>
