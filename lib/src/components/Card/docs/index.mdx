description: The Card component is a versatile container used to group related information in a visually distinct way. It often includes elements like a header, body, and footer, providing a cohesive layout for displaying content such as text, images, and actions. Cards enhance the user experience by organizing information into manageable sections.

### Header

The `Card.Header` should be placed at the top of the `Card.Body` component to display titles or introductory content. The `onClose` prop can be provided to automatically add a close button on the top right corner. The close button can be disabled by setting the `disabled` prop to true.

<div data-playground="header.tsx" data-component="Card"></div>

### Footer

The `Card.Footer` should be placed at the bottom of the `Card.Body` component to display supplementary information or actions related to the card's content.

<div data-playground="footer.tsx" data-component="Card"></div>

### Sizes

You can control the padding/font-size and overall size of the Card by using the `size` prop with the following options: `sm`, `md` (default) and `lg`.

<div data-playground="sizes.tsx" data-component="Card"></div>

### Link card

You can use the `as` prop to render the Card as a different HTML element, such as an anchor (`<a>`) tag for link cards.

<div data-playground="link.tsx" data-component="Card"></div>

### Disabled card

<div data-playground="disabled.tsx" data-component="Card"></div>

### Content card

<div data-playground="content.tsx" data-component="Card"></div>

### Picture card

<div data-playground="picture.tsx" data-component="Card"></div>
