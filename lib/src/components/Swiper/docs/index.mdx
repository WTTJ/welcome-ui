### Slides per view

Providing `slidesPerView` with `{ mobile: 1, tablet: 1, desktop: 2 }` will show 1 slide per view on mobile and tablet and 2 slides per view on desktop.

<div data-playground="slides-per-view.tsx" data-component="Swiper"></div>

### First slide to show

By providing `firstSlideToShow` with `2`, the swiper will begin on the second slide.

<div data-playground="first.tsx" data-component="Swiper"></div>

### Centered slides

By providing `centeredSlides`, the swiper will begin on the middle slide, `firstSlideToShow` won't be used in this case.

<div data-playground="centered.tsx" data-component="Swiper"></div>

### Autoplay

Providing `autoplay` lets the slides advance automatically. Pass `duration` to control the amount of time each slide shows for.

<div data-playground="autoplay.tsx" data-component="Swiper"></div>

### With pagination

By providing the optional `withPagination` with `{ mobile: true, desktop: true }`, you can activate the pagination on mobile/tablet and on desktop.

<div data-playground="pagination.tsx" data-component="Swiper"></div>

### Without navigation

By providing the optional `withNavigation` with `{ mobile: false, desktop: false }`, you can hide the navigation arrows on mobile/tablet and desktop, you still can scroll between slides.

<div data-playground="no-navigation.tsx" data-component="Swiper"></div>

### With dark UI

Use dark (black) colors for the pagination and arrows in case of slides too bright with `withDarkUI` props.

<div data-playground="dark.tsx" data-component="Swiper"></div>
