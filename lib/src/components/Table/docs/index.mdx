### With state

You can use one of `success`, `error`, `warning` or `info` and add `indent` on Table for more spacing.

<div data-playground="states.tsx" data-component="Table"></div>

### Clickable rows

You can make rows clickable by adding the `onClick` prop to `Table.Tr`.

<div data-playground="clickable.tsx" data-component="Table"></div>
