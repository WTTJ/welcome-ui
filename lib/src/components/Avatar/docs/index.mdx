### Image

We use `Shape` component. You can use size from theme or override with `w` and `h` size.

<div data-playground="images.tsx" data-component="Avatar"></div>

### Only text

Without image we add initials on the avatar with property `name`. We get by default ramdom color from sub colors to create the background, based on the name string. You can override with `color`. Font size is calculated automatically and can be override with `fontSize`property.

<div data-playground="texts.tsx" data-component="Avatar"></div>

### Shape

By default Avatar is a circle shape, change with property `shape`.

<div data-playground="shape.tsx" data-component="Avatar"></div>
