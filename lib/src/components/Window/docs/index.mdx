Use `Window` and `Window.Header` to create a structured window layout.

### Header

Use `Window.Header` to create the header section of your window. The header supports various sub-components for flexible layouts.

#### Title

Use `Window.Header.Title` to display a title in the header.

#### Tabs

Use `Window.Header.Tabs` to display tabs in the header. Requires a tab store and an array of tab items.

<div data-playground="tabs.tsx" data-component="Window"></div>

#### Left and Right Actions

Use `Window.Header.LeftActions` for expandable controls and `Window.Header.RightActions` for closable controls and custom action buttons.
