Add `w` and `h` to set size of shape.

### Border radius

Add `borderRadius` from theme or what you want.

<div data-playground="border-radius.tsx" data-component="Shape"></div>

### Shape

Set `shape` to `square` or `circle`, also, using `shape` with unequal sizes will match the biggest value between width / height.

<div data-playground="shapes.tsx" data-component="Shape"></div>
