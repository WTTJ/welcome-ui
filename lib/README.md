## How to release

The release of the library is automated by the CI, you just need to bump package version and push git tags to initiate the process.

### Release process

**The commands listed below will only prompt for library to bump**. Then they will modify package version, commit changes and create the git tag to finally push everything to github. **No further actions are required once you have validated the packages to bump.**

#### How to release

##### Production

(ex: **7.1.0**):

```bash
yarn release
```

##### Alpha

(ex: **7.1.0-alpha.0**)

Generate an alpha release for broader team testing:

```bash
yarn release:alpha
```

##### Development

(ex: **dev.1738060597**)

Create a development release based on the current timestamp for quick testing of pre-release features:

```bash
yarn release:dev
```

### About the CI

The CI will trigger on tags to build the packages and then push them to the npm registry
