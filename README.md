## ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨

Hi everyone,

We are currently migrating to TailwindCSS and expect to have a stable v9 release by the end of October 2025. ðŸš€

Until then, we are merging and migrating components one by one into the main branch. If you prefer to continue using styled-components, please use the [v8 branch](https://github.com/WTTJ/welcome-ui/tree/v8).

Thank you!

The Welcome to the Jungle dream team ðŸ’›
