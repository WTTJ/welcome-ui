Getting started

```js
import React from 'react'
import { createTheme } from 'welcome-ui/theme'
import { WuiProvider } from 'welcome-ui/WuiProvider'
import { Button } from 'welcome-ui/Button'

// Add theme options (if you want)
const options = {

      50: '#32CD32',
    },
  },
}

// Create your theme
const theme = createTheme(options)
export default function Root() {
  return (
    // Wrap your components with <WuiProvider /> with your theme
    <WuiProvider
      theme={theme}
      // Will inject a CSS reset with normalizer
      hasGlobalStyle
      // Will show the focus ring on keyboard navigation only
      shouldHideFocusRingOnClick
    >
      <Button>Welcome!</Button>
    </WuiProvider>
  )

```

## Develop on local

```bash
yarn start
```

3. Start documentation website

```bash
yarn website
```

4. and go to http://localhost:3020

## How to release

The release of the packages is automated by the CI, you just need to bump package version and push git tags to initiate the process.

### Initiating the release process from your environment

**The commands listed below will only prompt for packages to bump**. Then they will modify packages versions, commit changes and create the git tag to finally push everything to github. **No further actions are required once you have validated the packages to bump.**

#### If you just need to bump one version without switching from a prerelease to stable release, run:

```bash
yarn release
```

#### To create a new prerelease, run:

This is only used for the **first** prerelease. If you already published a v5.0.0-alpha.0 then you just need to run the first command.

```bash
yarn dev:prerelease
```

NB: you can replace alpha with any other keyword (beta, rc, ...)

#### Troubleshooting

##### How to rollback a release that has been stopped before publish to npm

Revert the last commit (which should be the commit that bumps package versions):

`git revert HEAD^`

Remove the tag on github and locally.

Then apply your fixes and re-run your release command.

### About the CI

The CI will trigger on tags to build the packages and then push them to the npm registry
