# Contributing

## Workflow

- Create your branch from master
- Run `yarn` to setup the development environment.
- Make the changes you want and test them out in the demo website before sending a pull request.
- Add all necessary information and examples in your pull request.

## Commit message convention

We follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention ‚ú®

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

- <strong>fix</strong>: patches a bug in your codebase
- <strong>feat</strong>: introduces a new feature to the codebase
- <strong>BREAKING CHANGE</strong>: introduces a breaking API change
- <strong>refactor</strong>: introduce code refactor
- <strong>docs</strong>: changes into documentation
- <strong>test</strong>: adding or updating tests
- <strong>chore</strong>: tooling changes, chore changes

We have a pre-commit hook to verify if your commit is correct üöî

## Writing components

  - `index.js`: The React component
  - `index.test.js`: Jest / react-testing-library tests for this component
  - `styles.js`: Any related `styled-components`
