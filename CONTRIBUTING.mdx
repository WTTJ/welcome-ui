# Contributing

## Workflow

- Create your branch from master
- Run `yarn` to setup the development environment.
- Make the changes you want and test them out in the demo website before sending a pull request.
- Add all necessary information and examples in your pull request.

## Commit message convention

We follow [conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) convention ✨

The commit contains the following structural elements, to communicate intent to the consumers of your library:

- <strong>fix</strong>: patches a bug in your codebase
- <strong>feat</strong>: introduces a new feature to the codebase
- <strong>BREAKING CHANGE</strong>: introduces a breaking API change
- <strong>refactor</strong>: introduce code refactor
- <strong>docs</strong>: changes into documentation
- <strong>test</strong>: adding or updating tests
- <strong>chore</strong>: tooling changes, chore changes

We have a pre-commit hook to verify if your commit is correct 🚔

## Writing components

Each component will consist of:

- `ComponentName`: Folder with name of component (PascalCase)
  - `src/index.tsx`: The React component
  - `src/styles.ts`: Any related `styled-components`
  - `src/utils.ts` : utils for this component
  - `tests/index.test.ts`: Vitest / react-testing-library tests for this component
